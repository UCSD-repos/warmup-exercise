<!-- Assignment overview:
1. Card Deck and Playing Card Web Components complete with animation of flip and/or shuffle 
    (HTML, CSS, and very light JS)

2. Dealing with the deck, complete with an ability to pull the cards one 
    or multiple at a time and state management of the deck (more JS + some simple web APIs) 

3. A simple game, either Solitaire or Black Jack Game, against an algorithmic dealer.  
    No multiplayer effort here or network work allowed.  
    The dealer may have a brain-dead, random, and correct mode for fun.  
    If you do BlackJack you need state for money to be tracked. (the most JS) -->
