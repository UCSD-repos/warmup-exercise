# Current State of Exercise: 
The end goal of this exercise is to have a functional playing card game. The current state of the exercise includes a functional card flip animation built using CSS and HTML. At the moment, the deck functionality built with JS that can be accessed through a console is the ability to create, print, shuffle, and reset a deck, as well as the option to draw a card.
